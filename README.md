# Github Documentation

## Description:
- Git is a distributed version control system. 
- Here the changes of the code or any other will be stored in the form of snapshots.

## Git Usage:
- It can be accessed via git bash a linux based terminal using git commands or else through git UI.
- Advantages:
  - Minimize loosing code.
  - Maintains code history.
  - Having read me will help other developers to understand the project.

## Git Work flow:
- **Pull** the latest code from the remote repo
- **Modify** the code with the updates
- **Add** the file
- check the **status** of the file
- **Commit** the file with a good message
- **push** the file to remote repo

### Gitbash commands:
> git clone "github_repo"
> Go to the directory using `cd` where you want to add a file to a remote repo.
> Create a new file if file doesnot exists or else modify the file.
```
1. git add <filename>
2. git status
3. git commit -m "commit message"
4. git push origin <branch name> if you are commiting from a branch apart from master
```
